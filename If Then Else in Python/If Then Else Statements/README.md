Python If-Then-Else Statements
------------------------------
Python supports the usual logical conditions from mathematics:

Equals: a == b Not Equals: a != b Less than: a < b Less than or equal to: a <= b Greater than: a > b Greater than or equal to: a >= b These conditions can be used in several ways, most commonly in "if statements" and loops.

An "if statement" is written by using the if keyword. The else keyword catches anything which isn't caught by the preceding conditions.

The if..else statement evaluates test expression and will execute the body of if only when the test condition is True . If the condition is False , the body of else is executed. Indentation is used to separate the blocks.
